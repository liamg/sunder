# sunder

*A terminal multiplexer for idiots*

Sunder aims to be two things:

1. A simple tmux alternative. The current state is a very poor man's tmux, but we'll get there :)
1. A set of packages constituting terminal middleware. You can use them to create your own terminal multiplexer, your own terminal, or something else!

## Keyboard Shortcuts

All Sunder keyboard shortcuts are started with `ctrl` + `a`, then a single keypress. For example, to split a pane vertically, you would press `ctrl` + `a`, then press `v`.

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| h   | Split pane horizontally
| v   | Split pane vertically

## TODO

- Add shortcut overlay on ctrl seq press
- Application key mode per terminal
- Add tabs
- Configuration management
- Status bar configuration a la shox
- Add attach/detach capability
- Create `Show HN` post

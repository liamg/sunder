# sunder

*A terminal multiplexer for idiots*

Sunder aims to be two things:

1. An simple tmux alternative. The current state is a very poor man's tmux, but we'll get there :)
1. A set of packages constituting terminal middleware. You can use them to create your own terminal multiplexer, your own terminal, or something else!
